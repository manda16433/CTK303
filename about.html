              Hey there! My name is Amanda and I'm the creator of Onset Apparel. This whole thing started with a lazy summer filled with drawing all day long. I was just drawing whatever
              I wanted and once I had compiled about 10 drawings, I figured it might be fun to try and do something with them. I had tried selling prints in the past but it never
              really worked out for me. So because of that, I had friends who had been selling their designs on clothes and I figured I'd give it a shot! Once the first few were posted,
              I created social media for the brand and started advertising and promoting and the rest is history! We might not have a huge following yet, but good things take time.
              I do all of this just to share my art with the world and hopefully give people some clothes they're happy to wear. All of the designs are original and created by me, while
              the printing aspect is done by TeeSpring. Check out any of our social media to send me messages, ask questions, or even request your own designs! Thanks for reading!
